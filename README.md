# Paradise Paw
## CSS Framework
- Pico.com
## API's
- fakerestapi.com
- thedogapi.com
## Challenges
- Our plan was to use google places api to pull in reviews but there weren't any reviews there yet so we ended up using the fakerestapi to pull in reviews of the amazon alexa just to show the functionality that we wanted
- We have had some issues working with pico trying to figure out how override certain css selectors.
## Successes
- We worked very well as a team and we all contributed to the project.
- We were able to produce a professional looking website
## Future Innovations
- Add functionality of emailing the owner of Paridise Paw booking information of clients.
- make the site more uniform
